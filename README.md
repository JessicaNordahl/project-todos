# Project Todos

This is a TO-DO-app.
It enabled user to write a list woth tasks. Each task can be made "complete" with a box, or removed/deleted.

I used React-Redux and styled components to create the app.


## The challenge

My first time using react-Redux and therefor learning how to work with a new locig.
Also first time using styled components, to design the app
