# Project Todos

This is a React/Redux app, where the user can create a list of TO-DO's and update each to-do with "completed" or "delete". 

## The problem

This was the first time creating a reducer, and it made me learn about how redux logic works.

I wanted to fully style the app within each component, and after spending time and learning -I managed to do so.
